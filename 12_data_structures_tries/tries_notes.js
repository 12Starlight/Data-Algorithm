/*
Tries:
  Time to learn yet another tree-based data structure, TRIES! A TRIE is a type
  of search tree used to efficiently store a set of string for later retrieval.
  In the long run, we will see that a path from root to any node in the trie
  will represent a prefix of at least one string in the set. This is why tries
  are also known as PREFIX TREES.
