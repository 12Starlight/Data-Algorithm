Whiteboarding Mock Interview Instructions:
  The following is a section containing a bank of problems to be used to conduct 
  mock interviews.

  Pair assignments change each day. One in the pair takes a question set A, the
  other takes question set B. The interviewer has a few interview questions, 
  plus one coding problem and its solution. He/she makes the other student, the
  interviewee, solve the problem as if they were doing a real interview. The
  interviewer cannot give out an actual answer, but should keep the interviewee
  on track with leading questions. The interviewee cannot ask for a hint or
  answer, but may ask insightful questions. Practice at least some of the
  problems on a whiteboard or on paper, it is what you will be given during
  in-person interviews.

  Give yourself time before starting, to make sure you understand the problem
  you will give your interviewee as well as its solution. Keep in mind that 
  multiple solutions are likely valid.

  You may not refer to the web unless the question assums technical knowledge
  that neither the interviewer nor the interviewee has (eg. the nature of a
  certain data structure). When the interviewee has found a solution, he or she
  should determine its time complexity and try to optimize.

  Finally, switch the roles with a new question set. If you are with an odd
  number of people, one group of three can be composed of two interviewers and
  an interviewee.
